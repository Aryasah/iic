              Bill Gates. Mark Zuckerberg. Larry Page. Sergey Brin. They share
              more than a few enviable accomplishments. They’re billionaires,
              they made their fortunes in tech and they started their businesses
              while they were still ‘students’. Undoubtedly, student life is one
              of the best times to venture into the world of innovation and
              entrepreneurship. Innovation Contest 2020 is, therefore, the right
              platform for the students of NIT Durgapur to give shape to their
              entrepreneurial dreams, with the institute supporting them through
              all the stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              IIIC urges every student of NIT Durgapur, across all the
              departments and years, to come forward with their ideas and make
              the most of the wonderful opportunity in front of them. All the
              best!
